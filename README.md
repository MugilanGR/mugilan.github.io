      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hello there!</p>
      <p>My name is Lyndsay.</p>
      <p>I am a learner and a problem solver! I earned my Bachelor’s in Mathematics from the University of Portland, and I’m also a proud graduate of University of Michigan’s School for Environment & Sustainability (SEAS) from which I earned my Master’s with a specialization in Geospatial Data Science.</p>
      <p>A born and raised Washingtonian, I appreciate the important and beautiful landscapes of the Pacific Northwest which have inspired my professional goals:</p>
      <p>I am passionate about using geospatial and remote sensing tools to analyze and learn more about our environment and society.</p>
      <p>I am eager to use my talents in a way that benefits the environment surrounding us.</p>
